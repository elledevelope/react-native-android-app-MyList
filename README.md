## How to Run
1. To carry out this project, we will primarily need the Node.js ecosystem and its package manager NPM. Please visit the following address:

https://nodejs.org/en/download

Install the latest stable version without the Chocolatey option.

2. Next, install the latest version of Android Studio:

https://developer.android.com/studio

Accept all the licenses requested during installation and then launch it. When the "Welcome to Android Studio" window opens, open the "More Actions" menu and select "SDK Manager." This will allow you to install the corresponding version(s) of Android. Also, accept the license for the installed version.

For the next step, go back to the opening window and, this time, select the "Virtual Device Manager" option from the "More Actions" menu. Delete the default emulator and create a new one corresponding to the previously installed Android version from the device of your choice.

3. Install Java JDK version 17.0.9, which you can find at the following address:
[jdk-17.0.9_windows-x64_bin.exe](https://www.oracle.com/fr/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html)

4. To test and compile this project, you will need to edit the system environment variables (here in Windows 11). Follow these steps:

    - Right-click on your Start menu.
    - Select `System`.
   -  Open `Advanced system settings`.
    - Click on `Environment Variables...`
    - In the `System Variables` window, click on `New`
    - The first variable should be named `ANDROID_HOME` with the value `C:\Users\your_username\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk`.
    - The second variable should be `JAVA_HOME` with the value `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17`.
    - Finally, add a new entry to the Path variable: `C:\Users\your_username\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools`.

5. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/elledevelope/React-native-MyList-android`

6. Navigate to the project folder: `cd project-name`

7. Run the project: `npx react-native start`
